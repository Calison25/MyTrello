#
# Example Settings
#
# This file can contain settings for your Flow application that override
# the various defaults defined by other packages.
#
# Copy this file to Settings.yaml, and adjust as necessary.
#
# For possible configuration options you may refer to the packages'
# default settings file(s) in the corresponding package directories (for
# example, Packages/Framework/Neos.Flow/Configuration/Settings.yaml)
# or read the fine manuals.
